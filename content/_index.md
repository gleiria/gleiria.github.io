Hi, I'm Gon√ßalo, welcome to my personal website. 

I'm a Graduate Research Assistant in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom. Currently, I'm working at the intersection of research software engineering, the development of microsimulations, and multi-objective optimisation, with a focus on decision analytic modelling in health care. Prior to this, I have worked as a bioinformatician, mainly involded in projects using single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of health, development and disease. I'm also passionate about continuously learning and improving my software development skills and best practices so that I can build more robust and maintainable systems. 

Beyond my professional life, I have a huge passion for longboard surfing and I love spending my free time in the ocean either surfing or swimming in open water. 

Please have a look at my [blog](/blog/), where I write about topics I am currently learning and interested in. 

Love to all :sunny: :sunny: :sunny:.
