When I first came across evolutionary biology and how life on the planet evolved from unicellular organisms to the astonishing biodiversity that we observe nowadays I got fascinated by it. Think about about natural selection -  organisms that are more adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and pass on the genes that aided their success ("survival of the fittest"). Genetic mutations that are beneficial to an individual's survival are passed on through reproduction resulting in a new generation that is more likely to survive and reproduce. Therefore genetic variety, or the mechanisms that lead to it, are the fuel for evolution to act upon.  

By that time, I had absolutely no idea about what evolutionary computation was so the idea of using algorithms inspired by natural selection to solve real world problems is completely mind blowing to me. In this article, I will, at a very high level, introduce genetic algorithms and, in case you are new to them, try to give you some intuition on how this fascinating class of evolutionary alogrithms work and can be used to find solutions to real world problems.

Consider that the following vector represents a hypotetical strategy to be adopted by a health care system in a 15 year timeline.

At each step, we have 11 possible strategies to choose from. For example, these strategies could represent different levels of intervention (it doesn't really matter what the intervention is), such as 0 for no action, 1 for full intervention, and values like 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9 representing partial interventions at varying degrees. The size of this search space (all possible feasible solutions) is astonishing. There are 11^15 possible combinations in this vector and it is simply impractical to exaushtively analyse this search space. Now, imagine we want to find the most effective strategy in the vector above. It is simply impractical to exaushtively analyse this search space and evaluate how good each different solution is with respect to some objective we might have (this could be the cheapest strategy to implement while reducing intensive care visits at the same time). And here is where the magic happens; we give this task to a genetic algorithm to do this for us. 


GAs are 1) population based, 2) adaptive (Simulates Darwianian evolution) genes, selection, fitness, reproductions, crossover, mutation

## General workflow

1. Initialization

We ask the algorithm to generate a population of candidate solutions. In our case, a bunch of screening vectors as the one we have above would be randomly generated. We have absolutely no idea of how good these solutions are.

2. Evaluation

Each individual (a solution) in the generated population of solutions will be passed to the objective functions that we have. In our case, each solution will be passed to the objective functions so each screening vector will have costs and number of hospitalisations associated to it. 

3. Mating 

We create an offspring population from our initial population. This process has three steps:

    * Selection: We use information from the evaluation step to select the fittest solutions. The fittest solutions are the ones that do the best job at minimising our two objective functions. Like mother nature does, we want to allow the fittest solutions to reproduce and generate offspring. 

    * Recombination: We take pairs of selected parents and recombine them to create a new individual (a new solution). Using the example of our screening vector, we could for example take the some entries in the vector from one parent and other entries from other parent and combined them to form a new individual. At this stage the generation of an offspring is not completed yet. We have to introduce a mutation in this new individual for the process to be completed.

    * Mutation: The process above recombines features from parents to generate new offspring but does not introduce uniqueness to the new individual. That is exatctely the purpose of the mutation step. It takes some property inherited from the parents and changes it. In our case, a mutation can be as simple changing the value of an entry in the vector say from 0.3 to 0.2. This is critical...

The ouput of mating is a new offspring population. Thus, at this stage we have two populations of the same size; the parent population and the offspring population. 

4. Survival

We merge the two populations (parents + offspring) and decide which solutions are worth keeping and which can be discarded. The output of the survival step in a new parent population that will enter the second generation (iteration) of the algorithm and step one starts again.

Previous post:

Now that we can start to test multiple 'what if' scenarions (i.e screening strategies) we may also integrate multi-objective optimisation techniques into the system. What would happen if we would screen children at different ages? Whould that reduce hospitalisations? What if every child was screened at the age of three, and only those at high genetic risk at later stages? How can we optimise for the most effective screening strategies while incurring the lowest possible costs for health care systems? The search space for potential screening strategies is huge, considering a 15-year timeline simulation where each year could employ 11 different screening strategies, for instance, 0 for screening no one, 1 for screening everyone, and the values from 0.1 to 0.9 representing screening the top 10% to 90%, in increments of 10%, of individuals based on the highest genetic risk scores. This creates a massive search space of possibilities, theoretically expanding to 11^15 possible solutions. In the next post in this series, we will explore how multi-objective optimisation techniques can help us to search for "good enough" solutions at the expense of possibly not finding the absolute best solution. We will delve into a fascinating class of heuristic algorithms inspired by natural evolution and the selection of species, known as genetic algortihms, and explore how these powerful computational methods mimic the process of natural selection to iteratively improve upon solutions to complex problems.
