Hi, I'm Gonçalo, welcome to my personal website. 

I'm a Graduate Research Assistant in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom. Currently, I'm working at the intersection of research software engineering, the development of microsimulations, and multi-objective optimisation, with a focus on decision analytic modelling in health care. Prior to this, I have worked as a bioinformatician, mainly involded in projects using single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of health, development and disease. I’m passionate about continuous learning and strengthening my software engineering and data engineering skills, and I use this website as a place to document what I’m learning and write about topics I’m actively exploring.

Beyond my professional life, I have a huge passion for surfing and I love spending my free time in the ocean either surfing or swimming in open water. 

Please have a look at my [blog](/blog/)

Love to all :sunny: :sunny: :sunny:.
