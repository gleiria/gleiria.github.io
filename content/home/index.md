Hi, I'm Gonçalo, welcome to my website.

I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Exeter, United Kingdom. Currently, I am working at the intersection of software engineering, the development of microsimulations, and multi-objective optimisation, with a focus on decision making in health care. Prior to this, I worked as a bioinformatician , mainly involded in projects using single-cell genomics to explore the  underlying molecular mechanisms of health, development and disease. Behond my professional live, I have a big passion for longboard surfing love spending time in the ocean either surfing or doing open water swimming. 

Please have a look at my [blog](/blog/), where I explore and discuss some of the topics that I am currently working on. I hope you find the content both helpful and interesting in some way.

Love to all.
