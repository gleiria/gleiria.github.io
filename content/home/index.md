Hi, I'm Gonçalo, welcome to my website.

I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Exeter, United Kingdom. Currently, I am working at the intersection of research software development, microsimulations, and multi-objective optimisation, with a focus on decision making in health care. Prior to this, I worked as a bioinformatician, mainly involded in projects using single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of health, development and disease. 

Beyond my professional life, I have a huge passion for longboard surfing and I love spending my free time in the ocean either surfing or swimming in open water. 

Please have a look at my [blog](/blog/), where I write about some of the topics that I am currently working on. I hope you find the content both helpful and interesting in some way.
