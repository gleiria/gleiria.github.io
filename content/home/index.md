Hi, I'm Gon√ßalo, welcome to my personal website. 

I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom. Currently, I am working at the intersection of research software engineering, the development of microsimulations, and multi-objective optimisation, with a focus on decision analytic modelling in health care. Prior to this, I have worked as a bioinformatician, mainly involded in projects using single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of health, development and disease. I also like to keep a close eye on the way that artificial intelligence is reshaping education and society in general. 

Beyond my professional life, I have a huge passion for longboard surfing and I love spending my free time in the ocean either surfing or swimming in open water. 

Please consider having a look at my [blog](/blog/), where I write about topics I am interested in and/or working on. 

Love to all :sunny: :sunny: :sunny:.
