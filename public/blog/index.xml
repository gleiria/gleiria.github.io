        <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of using computers to simulate real-world systems has been around for many decades. However, in recent years, with the democratisation and significant cost reductions of computational power, increased data availability, and advancements in artificial inteligence, computational simulations have reached new levels of sophistication and their applications, particularly in the healthcare care domain, are expanding very rapidly. This blog post provides a very brief overview on microsimulations and how integrating machine learning and multi-objective optimisation into these systems can help us to tackle a concrete healthcare challenge: optimising type 1 diabetes screening strategies while minimizing costs associated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
